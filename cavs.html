        <h1>Cavs</h1>
        <p>LeBron James began his NBA career with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003, instantly becoming the face of the franchise and a symbol of hope for a struggling team. 
            His presence transformed the Cavaliers into a competitive force, drawing national attention to a city that had long been overlooked in the basketball world. 
            Over the years, LeBron’s leadership and versatility allowed the team to contend with some of the league's best, creating unforgettable moments for fans. 
            His departure in 2010 was met with heartbreak and controversy, as many in Cleveland felt betrayed by the hometown hero. However, LeBron returned in 2014, a decision that mended strained relationships and reignited the city’s passion for basketball. 
            His second stint in Cleveland was marked by a more mature and focused approach, both on and off the court. 
            By the time he left again in 2018, LeBron's impact on the city and its basketball culture was undeniable and lasting.
