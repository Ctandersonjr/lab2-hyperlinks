        <h1>Heat</h1>
        <p>Lebron played for the Miami Heat in 2010 and played there until 2014.
           This move was very contreversial as he left his home team that drafted him in hopes to win a NBA championship. 
           Some say this move changed the course the National Basketball Association in terms of player impowerment.
           This was such a big deal because this led to decades of teams trying to put a ton of stars onto one team to form what media dubs as "superteams"".
           Below are a few of his accomplishments on the Heat.
